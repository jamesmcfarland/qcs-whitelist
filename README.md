# qcs-whitelist
This is a basic .NET 6 program which will take a set of minecraft IGNs and an email address, compare it against a list of known members and then use PlayerDB to get the UUIDs for those players, then finally generates the appropiate JSON, writes it to a file, then instructs the minecraft server to reload the whitelist
